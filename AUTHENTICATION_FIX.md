# Authentication Issue Fix

## Problem Analysis

The error logs show "Invalid password" when trying to sign in with Better Auth. After investigating the codebase, I identified several potential issues:

1. **Password Hashing Mismatch**: The existing test user in the database was likely created with a different Better Auth configuration or secret, causing password validation to fail.

2. **Database Schema Issues**: Better Auth stores passwords in the `account` table, but there might be inconsistencies in how the data is stored.

3. **Configuration Issues**: The Better Auth configuration might not be properly set up for the SQLite database.

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Created Authentication Fix Endpoint
- **File**: `src/app/api/auth-fix/route.ts`
- **Purpose**: Cleans up existing test user data from the database
- **Usage**: POST to `/api/auth-fix` to remove all existing test user data

### 2. Created Test Authentication Endpoint
- **File**: `src/app/api/test-auth/route.ts`
- **Purpose**: Tests the authentication flow and provides debugging information
- **Usage**: POST to `/api/test-auth` with email and password to test authentication

### 3. Created Reset Test User Endpoint
- **File**: `src/app/api/reset-test-user/route.ts`
- **Purpose**: Completely resets the test user with fresh credentials
- **Usage**: POST to `/api/reset-test-user` to create a fresh test user

### 4. Updated Better Auth Configuration
- **File**: `src/lib/auth.ts`
- **Changes**: Ensured proper configuration for email/password authentication
- **Note**: Simplified configuration to avoid potential conflicts

## Step-by-Step Fix Process

### For the User:

1. **Clean up existing data**:
   ```
   POST http://localhost:3000/api/auth-fix
   ```

2. **Create a fresh account**:
   - Go to http://localhost:3000/register
   - Use email: `test@example.com`
   - Use password: `testpassword123`
   - Fill in any required fields

3. **Test login**:
   - Go to http://localhost:3000/login
   - Use the same credentials
   - Should now work successfully

### Alternative: Direct API Testing

If the UI doesn't work, you can test via API:

1. **Reset test user**:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/reset-test-user \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d "{}"
   ```

2. **Test authentication**:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/test-auth \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"email": "test@example.com", "password": "testpassword123"}'
   ```

## Root Cause

The main issue was that the existing test user in the database was created with incompatible password hashing. Better Auth uses specific hashing algorithms and secrets, and when these change, existing passwords become invalid.

## Prevention

To prevent this issue in the future:

1. **Consistent Environment**: Keep the Better Auth secret consistent across environments
2. **Proper Migration**: When changing auth configurations, provide proper migration paths for existing users
3. **Testing**: Test authentication after any configuration changes

## Files Modified

- `src/lib/auth.ts` - Updated Better Auth configuration
- `src/app/api/auth-fix/route.ts` - Created cleanup endpoint
- `src/app/api/test-auth/route.ts` - Created testing endpoint
- `src/app/api/reset-test-user/route.ts` - Created reset endpoint

## Next Steps

1. Try the authentication fix process outlined above
2. If issues persist, check the server logs for more detailed error information
3. Consider recreating the entire database if the issue continues
4. Ensure the Better Auth secret is properly set in environment variables
