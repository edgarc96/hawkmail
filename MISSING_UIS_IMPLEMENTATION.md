const [webhooks, setWebhooks] = useState<any[]>([]);
const [newWebhookUrl, setNewWebhookUrl] = useState('');
const [selectedWebhookEvents, setSelectedWebhookEvents] = useState<string[]>([]);

// Business Hours
const [businessHours, setBusinessHours] = useState({ ... });
const [holidays, setHolidays] = useState<string[]>([]);

// Customer Tiers
const [customerTiers, setCustomerTiers] = useState<any[]>([]);
const [newTierEmail, setNewTierEmail] = useState('');
const [newTierLevel, setNewTierLevel] = useState<'vip' | 'enterprise' | 'standard'>('standard');
```

### **API Integration:**
Connected to existing backend APIs:
