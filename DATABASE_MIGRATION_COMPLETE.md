{
  "url": "https://your-app.com/webhook",
  "events": [
    "email.received",
    "email.replied",
    "sla.breached"
  ],
  "headers": {
    "X-Custom-Header": "value"
  }
}
```

### **2. List Webhooks**

GET /api/webhooks/subscribe
```

### **3. Delete Webhook**
```bash
DELETE /api/webhooks/subscribe?id=1
```

## 🔒 Security Features

1. **HMAC Signature Verification**
   - Each webhook includes `X-Webhook-Signature` header
   - Uses SHA-256 HMAC with secret key
   - Prevents unauthorized webhook spoofing

2. **Automatic Retry Logic**
   - Failed deliveries retry up to 3 times
   - Exponential backoff (2s, 4s, 8s)
   - All attempts logged in `webhook_logs`

3. **Delivery Tracking**
   - Complete audit trail of all deliveries
   - Status codes and response bodies stored
   - Easy debugging of failed webhooks

## 📋 Supported Webhook Events

| Event | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `email.received` | New email received in system |
| `email.replied` | Email was replied to |
| `email.assigned` | Email assigned to team member |
| `email.resolved` | Email marked as resolved |
| `sla.warning` | SLA deadline approaching (20% remaining) |
| `sla.breached` | SLA deadline exceeded |
| `alert.created` | New alert generated |
| `team.member.added` | New team member added |
| `team.performance.updated` | Team performance metrics updated |

---

## 🧪 Testing Webhooks

### **1. Create a Test Webhook**

Use webhook.site for testing:
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/webhooks/subscribe \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "url": "https://webhook.site/your-unique-id",
    "events": ["email.received", "email.replied"]
  }'
```

### **2. Trigger an Event**

Create or update an email to trigger webhooks:
- Receive new email → triggers `email.received`
- Reply to email → triggers `email.replied`
- Assign email → triggers `email.assigned`

### **3. Check Delivery**

Visit webhook.site to see the payload received.

## 🔄 Integration Examples

### **Slack Integration**
```javascript
// Webhook receives event
app.post('/webhook', (req, res) => {
  const { event, data } = req.body;
  
  if (event === 'sla.breached') {
    sendSlackMessage({
      channel: '#alerts',
      text: `🚨 SLA BREACHED: ${data.email.subject}`
    });
  }
  
  res.sendStatus(200);
});
```

### **Zapier Integration**
1. Create webhook URL in Zapier
2. Subscribe to events in your dashboard
3. Configure Zapier workflow (send to Slack, update CRM, etc.)

### **Custom Dashboard**
```javascript
// Real-time dashboard updates
app.post('/webhook', (req, res) => {
  const { event, data } = req.body;
  
  // Update dashboard via WebSocket
  io.emit('update', { event, data });
  
  res.sendStatus(200);
